; An Xexpr.v0 (short for X-expression) is a one-item list:
;   (cons Symbol '())

; An Xexpr.v1 is a list:
;   (cons Symbol [List-of Xexpr.v1])

; An Xexpr.v2 is a list: 
; – (cons Symbol Body)
; – (cons Symbol (cons [List-of Attribute] Body))
; where Body is short for [List-of Xexpr.v2]
; An Attribute is a list of two items:
;   (cons Symbol (cons String '()))


; Represent this XML data as elements of Xexpr.v2:

; <transition from="seen-e" to="seen-f" />
'(transition ((from "seen-e") (to "seen-f")))

; <ul><li><word /><word /></li><li><word /></li></ul>
'(ul (li (word) (word)) (li (word)))


; Q: Which one could be represented in Xexpr.v0 or Xexpr.v1?
; A: The second one can be represented in Xexpr.v1
