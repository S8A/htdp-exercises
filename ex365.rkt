; An Xexpr.v0 (short for X-expression) is a one-item list:
;   (cons Symbol '())

; An Xexpr.v1 is a list:
;   (cons Symbol [List-of Xexpr.v1])

; An Xexpr.v2 is a list: 
; – (cons Symbol Body)
; – (cons Symbol (cons [List-of Attribute] Body))
; where Body is short for [List-of Xexpr.v2]
; An Attribute is a list of two items:
;   (cons Symbol (cons String '()))


; Interpret the following elements of Xexpr.v2 as XML data:

'(server ((name "example.org")))
; <server name="example.org" />

'(carcas (board (grass)) (player ((name "sam"))))
; <carcas> <board> <grass /> </board> <player name="sam" /> </carcas>

'(start)
; <start />

; Q: Which ones are elements of Xexpr.v0 or Xexpr.v1?
; A: The third one is an element of Xexpr.v0 (and Xexpr.v1, consequently).
